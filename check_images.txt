Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The three model architectures did classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed (golden retriever)

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed classified in Dog_02.jpg. For VGG, Dog_02.jpg was classified as a dandie dinmont. For ResNet, it was classified as a llama. Finally for AlexNet, it was classified as a coyote. 


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The three model architectures correctly classified both Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I believe that VGG did the best at classifying the four uploaded images as this model accurately identified the images as dog or not-a-dog 100% of the time while the other models identified the images as dog/not-a-dog only 50% of the time.
